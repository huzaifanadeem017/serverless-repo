## About Me
Hi, my name is Huzaifa Nadeem and I am a senior year Computer Science Student at University of Illinois at Chicago. I am graduating in Fall 2022 with a Bachelors Degree with Computer Systems concentration. 

I got started with coding by modding video games and through out college, I've gained experience in C++, Java (UI/UX Design), Haskell and GoLang. Recently I got involved into AI and built a 15 puzzle AI solver using BFS/DFS and iterative deepning DFS. Moreover, I built a security camera system using Arduino that takes pictures when a motion is detected and stores them into a SD card.  

Currently I am a TA for "Machine and Finite Automata" course at my university where I tutor the course every week in my office hours. Other duties include grading, coming up with questions for homeworks and labs and provide online assistance to students. 

Besides all this I am a professional drummer, a cinematographer and I own an international artist promoter company with my Dad to arrange concerts throughout US.
